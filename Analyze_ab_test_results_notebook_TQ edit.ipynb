Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n",

    "**As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the scope of this project, we helped the company to understand whether they should implement a new page or keep the old page with following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability based approach\n",
    "- A/B test\n",
    "- Regression approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability based approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability section helped us better understand our dataset and ensure it is correct, consistent and useable. Based on the data, we found that the probability of converting given an individual was in the control group (0.1204) is higher than the probability of converting given an individual was in the treatment group (0.1188), which seems to support the conclusion that the company should keep the old page. However, without further analysis, we cannot say whether this oberservation is statistically significant or due to chance. Here A/B test and regression will come into play to help us draw conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A/B test:\n",
    "\n",
    "In A/B test we set up our hypotheses to test if the new page results in better conversion or not. We performed sampling distribution over 10,000 iterations to simulate the distribution of differences in converted between the two pages under the null hypothesis, by using a random binomial distribution with specified number of trials and converted success rate. We then computed the p-value by finding the proportion of values in the null distribution that were greater than our observed difference in conversion, which is 0.9063 in this case, and hence rejected null hypothsis and conclude that the new page has no impact on conversion. By using the built-in stats.proportions_ztest we computed z-score and p-value which confirmed our earlier p-value and failure to reject null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We aimed at predicting two possible outcomes, convert or not. Therefore, logistic regression is applied in this approach. With logistic regression results, we again encountered same statistics, which verified our conclusions from A/B test. By further adding geographic location of the users, we tried to explore if any specific country had an impact on conversion. The result gave a similar outlook and suggested that the countries have no impact on the conversion rate. The same story repeated for the interaction between types of page and user conuntries, which has no impact on the conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggestions:\n",
    "Other factors that might influence whether or not an individual converts:\n",
    "- Novelty effect and change aversion when existing users first experience a change.\n",
    "- Long enough run time for the experiment to account for changes in behavior based on time of day/week or seasonal events. In this case, the duration of experiment is only 21 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional terms that can be added into our regression model:\n",
    "- Duration of the experiment.\n",
    "- Click through rate.\n",
    "- Project revenue.\n"
